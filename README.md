# squery-jooq

SQuery to SQL with the power of [JOOQ](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ)  
Write SQuery and generate SQL, or send the query directly for execution.

Clojure is functional general programming language with macros, allowing us to
create compact DSL's without the need to use extra languages in our code.

## Example

**SQuery**
```
(q :author
   (join :book (= :author.id :book.author_id))
   ((= :book.title "1984") (> :book.published_in 2008))
   (group :author.first_name :author.last_name)
   ((> (count-acc) 5))
   (sort :author.last_name)
   (limit 2)
   (skip 1)
   [:author.first_name :author.last_name (count-acc)])
```

**SQL**
```
SELECT AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, COUNT(*)
FROM AUTHOR
JOIN BOOK ON AUTHOR.ID = BOOK.AUTHOR_ID
WHERE BOOK.LANGUAGE = 'DE'
AND BOOK.PUBLISHED_IN > 2008
GROUP BY AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAST_NAME
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY AUTHOR.LAST_NAME ASC NULLS FIRST
LIMIT 2
OFFSET 1
```

**JOOQ**
```
create.select(AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, count())
.from(AUTHOR)
.join(BOOK).on(BOOK.AUTHOR_ID.eq(AUTHOR.ID))
.where(BOOK.LANGUAGE.eq("DE"))
.and(BOOK.PUBLISHED_IN.gt(2008))
.groupBy(AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAST_NAME)
.having(count().gt(5))
.orderBy(AUTHOR.LAST_NAME.asc().nullsFirst())
.limit(2)
.offset(1);
```
